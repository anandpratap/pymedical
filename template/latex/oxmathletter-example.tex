\subject{Departmental \LaTeX{} Letter Class similar to Word Version}  
% optional subject line

\opening{Dear Earnest,}  % initial greeting/opening

This is a new letter class based on the standard \LaTeX{} letter class.

The university has specifically chosen a commercial font, Foundry Sterling
Book, for the header and footer text on official documents. The original font
is a truetype font and has been specifically installed on the departmental
Linux systems for use with this new class.

Note the font works with PDF\LaTeX{} (or Xe\LaTeX) but not ordinary \LaTeX!

This example tex file contains comments explaining the options/commands.

\closing{Yours sincerely} % closing phrase
\end{letter}
